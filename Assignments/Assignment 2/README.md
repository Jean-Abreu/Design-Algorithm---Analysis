##  Overview
This project implements and analyzes two divide-and-conquer algorithms for square matrix multiplication:

1. **Standard Recursive Method** – Uses 8 sub-multiplications per recursion level  
   \(T(n) = 8T(n/2) + \Theta(1) \Rightarrow \Theta(n^3)\)

2. **Strassen’s Algorithm** – Reduces the number of multiplications to 7  
   \(T(n) = 7T(n/2) + \Theta(n^2) \Rightarrow \Theta(n^{2.81})\)

The goal is to compare the computational performance of both algorithms using various matrix sizes and determine when Strassen’s method becomes more efficient.

## Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `standard.py` | Implements the **standard divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication** algorithm with recursive splitting, automatic padding, and a base case optimized using NumPy’s `@` operator. |
| `strassen.py` | Implements **Strassen’s matrix multiplication** with seven sub-multiplications, recursive combination logic, and padding support for non-power-of-two matrices. |
| `compare.py` | Benchmark and comparison script that runs both algorithms for various matrix sizes, measures execution times, and saves results to a CSV file. |
| `results.csv` | Output data file automatically generated by `compare.py` containing median runtime results (in milliseconds). |
